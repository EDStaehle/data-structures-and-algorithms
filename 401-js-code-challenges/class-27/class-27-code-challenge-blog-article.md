# An Introduction to the mergeSort Algorithm

## What is the Merge Sort Algorithm?

Merge sort is a well-regarded sorting algorithm that is renowned for its efficiency and dependability. It functions by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting them, and then merging them back together in a way that produces a fully sorted array.

One of the primary advantages of employing merge sort is that it is a "divide and conquer" algorithm. This signifies that it decomposes a large problem into smaller, more manageable pieces, which facilitates its solution. In the case of sorting an array, the algorithm divides the array into smaller subarrays until it can no longer be divided, at which point the subarrays are merged back together in a manner that guarantees that the resulting array is fully sorted.

## How Does it Work?

To understand how merge sort works, it's helpful to consider the following example:

`[9, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 10, 1, 8]`
If we want to sort this array using merge sort, the first thing we would do is divide the array into smaller subarrays until we can't divide anymore. For example, we might divide the array into the following subarrays:

`[9, 2, 5, 6] [4, 3, 7, 10, 1, 8]`
Next, we would apply the merge sort algorithm to each of these subarrays until they are fully sorted. For example:

`[9, 2] [5, 6] [4, 3] [7, 10, 1, 8]`
At this point, we would begin merging the subarrays back together in a way that ensures that the resulting array is fully sorted. We would continue this process until we have a fully sorted array:

`[2, 9] [5, 6] [3, 4] [1, 8, 10, 7]`

`[2, 5, 6, 9] [1, 3, 4, 8, 7, 10]`

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
As you can see, the merge sort algorithm is a powerful tool for sorting arrays. It is efficient, reliable, and easy to implement, making it a popular choice among developers. If you have an array that needs to be sorted, consider using the merge sort algorithm to get the job done.

## Practicality in Tech Interviews.

In a technical interview, the interviewer may ask you to demonstrate your problem-solving and coding abilities by implementing the merge sort algorithm to solve a specific problem, such as sorting an array of integers. To effectively utilize this "divide and conquer" algorithm, you must write a function that takes an array as input, divides it into smaller subarrays, applies the merge sort algorithm to each subarray until they are fully sorted, and finally merges the sorted subarrays to form a fully sorted array. It is crucial to test the function to ensure its accuracy through the creation and implementation of test cases. The merge sort algorithm is a practical choice for array sorting due to its efficiency, reliability, and ease of implementation. While other sorting algorithms may be available, merge sort is a suitable option for many applications and is likely to be well-received by interviewers.
